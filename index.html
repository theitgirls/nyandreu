            "Hi, I'm Natalia! I am going to be a sophomore this school year, and I'm from Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. I wanted to learn more about information technology and was looking for courses and applied for this one.

        <p>
             I like to listen to music, draw, and play video games. My favorite TV shows are Hannibal and Moon Knight. My favorite movies are Heathers, Shawshank Redemption, Marvel movies, and Knives Out. (It's kind of cliche but) I like Harry Potter book series and I also like The Cruel Prince. I have a dog called Luna.

            I'm super excited to work with everyone!"
