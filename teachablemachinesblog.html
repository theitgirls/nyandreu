            <h3>What was built?</h3>
            <p>
                We built a machine that can tell the difference between a black cat, a calico cat, and a siberian cat.

            <h3>How can I see artificial intelligence being used in another way?</h3>
            <p>
                I see artificial intelligence being used for medicine, where it can help identify and diagnose different diseases. However, this should still require human supervision just in case the AI makes an incorrect diagnosis.
